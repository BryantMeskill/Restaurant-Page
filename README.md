This project was made with inspiration from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to further enhance my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

## Here are a few of the skills I honed in on this project: ##
* Utilizing Webpack to cleanly bundle code and assets into a single distribution folder.
* Modularizing my coding procedures to allow for a more tidy and clean workspace.
* Imports/exports; feeding linear JavaScript files necessary functions and assets. 
* DOM manipulation; every element rendered is created via JavaScript and appended to the DOM.
* More sophisticated animations and specificity used to eliminate unnecessary code.

I really enjoyed this project and took my time to ensure the code was clean and well organized. I had fun and learned a lot about wepback and modularizing my code. I find it far more enjoyable and the cleanliness really helps keep things organized. Wepback is also great for bundling all the necessary files into one place and makes deploying and pathing issues a lot easier to deal with.
